    	<h2>Asteroid 1998 OR2 to Safely Fly Past Earth This Week: 28th April</h2></br>
    	<p>A large near-Earth asteroid will safely pass by our planet on Wednesday morning, providing astronomers with an exceptional opportunity to study the 1.5-mile-wide (2-kilometer-wide) object in great detail.

The asteroid, called 1998 OR2, will make its closest approach at 5:55 a.m. EDT (2:55 a.m. PDT). While this is known as a "close approach" by astronomers, it's still very far away: The asteroid will get no closer than about 3.9 million miles (6.3 million kilometers), passing more than 16 times farther away than the Moon.</p>

    	<h2>Spitzer Telescope Reveals the Precise Timing of a Black Hole Dance: 28th April</h2></br>
    	<p>The recently retired infrared observatory was the only telescope to spot a far-off flash of light that holds clues about the physical characteristics of these cosmic mysteries.
Black holes aren't stationary in space; in fact, they can be quite active in their movements. But because they are completely dark and can't be observed directly, they're not easy to study. Scientists have finally figured out the precise timing of a complicated dance between two enormous black holes, revealing hidden details about the physical characteristics of these mysterious cosmic objects.</p>

    	<h2>The 'Camera That Saved Hubble':1st May </h2></br>
    	<p>This story was originally published in December 2018, on the 25th anniversary of the first mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. April 24, 2020, marks 30 years since Hubble's launch.

In December 1993, NASA held its collective breath as seven astronauts on space shuttle Endeavour caught up with the Hubble Space Telescope 353 miles (568 kilometers) above Earth. Their mission: to fix a devastating flaw in the telescope's primary mirror.

About the size of a school bus, the Hubble Space Telescope has an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror. The largest optical telescope ever launched into space, where it could observe the universe free from the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere, Hubble had a lot riding on it.</p>

    	<h2>NASA Observes Earth Day With Downloadable Art:3rd May</h2></br>
    	<p>â€º Larger view
To honor the day's 50th anniversary, NASA's JPL has unveiled posters in which our home planet is the star.
When Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders snapped the iconic Earthrise image, it captured the imagination of the people on Earth and helped to inspire the first Earth Day, on April 22, 1970. In the image, our planet hangs at a gibbous phase, as a far-off world rising in the night sky, and reminds us of the fragility of our home.

"We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth," was how Anders summed up the astonishing sight.</p>

    	<h2>NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover Gets Its Wheels and Air Brakes:5th May</h2></br>
    	<p>After the rover was shipped from JPL to Kennedy Space Center, the team is getting closer to finalizing the spacecraft for launch later this summer.
Final assembly and testing of NASA's Perseverance rover continues at Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the July launch window approaches. In some of the last steps required prior to stacking the spacecraft components in the configuration they'll be in atop the Atlas V rocket, the rover's wheels and parachute have been installed. </p>

    	<h2>The Space Station's Coolest Experiment Gets Astronaut-Assisted Upgrade:12th May</h2></br>
    	<p>The Cold Atom Lab is using microgravity to learn about atoms and the quantum world, which could pave the way for new technologies in space and on the ground.
NASA's Cold Atom Laboratory, a facility for fundamental physics experiments on the International Space Station, recently underwent a major hardware upgrade with the help of astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir. By chilling atom clouds to just above absolute zero - the lowest temperature matter can reach - Cold Atom Lab enables scientists to directly observe unique atomic behaviors, helping answer questions about how our world works at the smallest scales. The new hardware will dramatically expand Cold Atom Lab's capabilities.</p>
